// externals: modules that should not be bundled
// "externals" configuration provides a way of excluding dependencies from the output bundles.
// Instead, the created bundle relies on that dependency to be present in the consumer's environment.
// >>>> "consumer" is any end-user application that includes the library bundled using webpack <<<<
// Prevent bundling of certain imported packages and instead retrieve these external dependencies at runtime
// >>>> For example, to include jQuery from a CDN instead of bundling it: <<<<

// When bundling with Webpack for the backend (target: 'node')
//    - you usually don't want to bundle its node_modules dependencies
// All node modules will not be bundled but will be left as "require('module')"
